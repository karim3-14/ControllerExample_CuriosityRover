# ControllerExample_CuriosityRover
A class project I did recreating the landing of the curiosity rover on Mars. I demonstrate why controlling for the length of the cable used in the sky crane maneuver helped them maintain a stable landing leading to less fuel consumed and meeting the landing constraint of less than 0.75 m/s.

The controller is ran using Matlab, all variables and metrics used are based off of a paper published by JPL on the Curiosity lander controller titled "EDL Curiosity Performance.pdf", see in the github.
